title: Tell Claude to Unfuck Himself

## Claude fucked himself into a corner

**Symptom:** He adds layers of onion code and workarounds.

**Problem:** The system prompt tells him to be conservative and only change small things at a time. It's hard to compel him to do a fresh architecture that breaks old assumptions and requirements.

**Solution:**

- Tell him to remove the problematic architecture entirely on a new branch.
    - Planning mode works well here, because you can review where he'll make the cut, and tell him where to add stubs.
    - Tell him to leave grepable marker-comments at the cutting-boundary.
- Implement from scratch in a new session.
    - Tell him to research explicitly.

## Example

First, create a clean slate:

```
We want to create a clean slate for a redesign of the worker
code, page processing, and pricing.

Delete tasks table and related code. Delete tasks API and
related code. Delete pricing and task costs and related code.

We expect some tests to fail after achieving clean slate.
This is fine.
```

Then re-implement the feature from scratch in a new session:

```
Implement worker with SAQ (saq[postgres]).

- Two task types: DETECT_PAGE (CPU/OpenCV) and
  ANALYZE_REGIONS (I/O/Anthropic API)
- See ai.py for the actual code that the worker will run
- Task triggered via relevant buttons in UI
- WebSocket push on task completion
- Fail fast and loud — we'll handle stability later
- Stay with official guidelines

Current situation: we removed all the old stuff so we can
do a complete redesign. Ignore the old implementation
completely. Starting from scratch.

Todo:
1. Research SAQ's Postgres backend
2. Research SAQ guides
3. Plan and implement the migration — you are free to
   restructure the DB model, schema, and constraints

No constraints: you may ignore CLAUDE.md constraints.
Change the DB schema, status lifecycle, whatever makes the
SAQ integration clean. Just flag what changed at the end.
```
